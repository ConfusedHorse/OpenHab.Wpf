# OpenHab.Wpf

This repository includes a WPF application which is meant to control things of an OpenHAB server instance, and creating rules using drag and drop functionality. It was develoved within the scope of a my masters paper as a prototypical implementation. It makes use of the open source library Elysium Extra for it's visual appearance.

If you accidently find yourself reading this and happen to be bored enought testing it for whatever reason, make sure to embed the required REST API client project which you can finde here: [OpenHab.NetRestApi](https://github.com/ConfusedHorse/OpenHab.NetRestApi)

Probably there will be no further updates to this project in the near future. But maybe I'll come back to it one day. If you have any thoughts about it please let me know. :)
